//! Window chrome metrics the webview cannot read on its own.
//!
//! The title bar, the menu strip and the tab strip are self-drawn
//! (`decorations: false`, HTML), so the sizes a desktop gives its own chrome
//! never reach the layout by themselves: a webview inherits colours and the
//! device pixel ratio from the operating system, but no metric, and CSS has no
//! system keyword for a caption's or a menu bar's height. Windows answers for
//! all three — the frame it reserves above a standard window's client area,
//! `SM_CYMENU` with its menu font, and `SM_CYSMSIZE` for a tab — while macOS and
//! Linux draw that chrome through whatever the desktop picked and expose nothing
//! to read, so both stand on the values those desktops use, by convention.
//!
//! Everything is returned in logical CSS pixels, the unit the webview lays out
//! in, so a window on a scaled display keeps the same chrome at every zoom level.
